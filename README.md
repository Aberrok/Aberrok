### Hi there 👋,I'm Abdelatti Errokhsy

My name is Abdelatti Errokhsy. I'm currently a fourth-year student of cyber security, studying at UEMF. Over the past few years, I've developed a passion for understanding how to secure and protect sensitive information in our increasingly digital world. I'm excited to learn more about the latest trends and technologies in the field, and to contribute to the community through my studies and future work. Nice to meet you all
